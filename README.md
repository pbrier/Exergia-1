Exergia-1
=========

Small prototyping board for MSP430.
* Aimed at RC and robotic applications (with 3 pin servo connections)
* 3V3 voltage regulator onboard
* 2 LEDS (1 power, 1 programmable)
* +/- Power terminals on corners of the PCB
* 4 pin programming connector on top of PCB (connects to Launchpad programmer board)

Two versions of the PCB:
* Through hole version (Easy to solder)
